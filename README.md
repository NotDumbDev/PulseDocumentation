# Pulse
**A Structured & Reliable Messaging Layer for Roblox**

Pulse is a lightweight framework built on top of Roblox's [`MessagingService`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/MessagingService).  
It turns raw publish / subscribe into **servers**, **topics**, and **utilities** that make cross server communication **organized, reliable, and extensible**.  

---

## âœ¨ Features
- **Smart Subscriptions** â€“ Safely subscribe, unsubscribe, and track listeners.  
- **Safe & Reliable** â€“ Extra guardrails on top of `MessagingService` to reduce errors.  
- **Extensible by Design** â€“ Add utilities without fighting the API.  
- **Simple API** â€“ Learn it in minutes, scale it with ease.
